## 🔐 Security

This project is **completely leak-proof**:

| API Keys | Encrypted with AES-256, stored server-side only |
| Passwords | Never in code, set via dashboard or environment |
| Personal Data | Gitignored, never committed to repository |
| System Prompts | Server-side only, invisible to visitors |
| Rate Limits | Built-in protection against abuse (100 req/day/IP) |

**Dashboard is hidden** - No visible links on public site. Only you know it exists at `/dashboard`.
